# MLModel1
First model to experment MLOps, CI CD and several other Operative featuers

]You can set up a completely free CI/CD pipeline for your ML model using GitHub Actions, and it's a great way to automate testing, training, and deployment without paying for third-party services.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to set up CI/CD for your ML project:

1. Pre-requisites:
A GitHub repository with your ML model code.

Docker or Python-based project (e.g., requirements.txt, Dockerfile, etc.).

Optional: Deployment target (e.g., Hugging Face, AWS S3, Google Cloud, etc.).

2. Basic Folder Structure Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
/my-ml-project
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml   # GitHub Actions pipeline
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt              # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ train.py                     # Model training script
â”œâ”€â”€ test_model.py                # Tests for model
â”œâ”€â”€ model.pkl                    # Trained model artifact (after training)
â””â”€â”€ README.md
3. Create GitHub Actions Workflow:
Create a file at:

bash
Copy
Edit
.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
Minimal Example:
yaml
Copy
Edit
name: ML CI/CD Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build-test-train:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run unit tests
      run: |
        pytest test_model.py

    - name: Train model
      run: |
        python train.py

    - name: Upload model artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: trained-model
        path: model.pkl
4. Explanation:
âœ… Trigger: Runs on every push or pull_request.
âœ… Steps:

Checks out the repo.

Sets up Python.

Installs dependencies from requirements.txt.

Runs unit tests (pytest recommended).

Trains the ML model.

Uploads the trained model as an artifact (you can later download it from GitHub).

5. Optional: Add Deployment (Free Options)
You can extend this pipeline to deploy:

To Hugging Face Hub (free)

To GitHub Pages (for models with frontends)

To Google Drive/S3 (via CLI)

Or use Streamlit Community Cloud to deploy ML apps for free.

Example for Hugging Face deployment:

yaml
Copy
Edit
    - name: Upload to Hugging Face Hub
      run: |
        pip install huggingface_hub
        python upload_to_huggingface.py  # script using huggingface_hub APIs
6. Free Tier Limits:
GitHub Actions (free plan):

2000 mins/month for public + private repos.

Unlimited for public repos.

Ubuntu runners are free.

7. (Optional) Notify on Failure:
Add Slack/Email notifications for CI/CD failures:

yaml
Copy
Edit
    - name: Notify via Slack
      uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1.24.0
      with:
        payload: '{"text":"CI/CD Pipeline Failed ðŸ˜¢"}'
